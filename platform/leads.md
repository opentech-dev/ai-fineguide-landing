## Leads Collection

In Fineguide, AI Agents can identify user intent from conversations, enabling the generation of potential leads. Agents can prompt clients for their email or phone number, allowing businesses to follow up effectively. This feature is disabled by default and must be manually enabled. To do so, navigate to your Agent page, click the `Features` tab, and scroll to the `Lead Collection` section.

Once enabled, you can select from three options:

1. **"Allow full conversations, collect lead details if customer shows interest"** (Default)  
   The agent will request contact details only if the user demonstrates interest in the product or service.

2. **"Allow conversations, ask lead details on each reply"**  
   The agent will engage in conversation but will request contact details with every reply.

3. **"Insist on lead details before engaging in conversation"**  
   The agent will refuse to proceed with any conversation until contact details are provided.

Choose the option that best suits your business needs and desired lead generation approach.



## Leads Tab

Whenever a user provides their contact details, a new lead is automatically created in the `Leads` module accessible from the main menu. This module consolidates all leads generated by every bot within your workspace, providing a centralized location for lead management.

### Key Features:
- **Unified Lead Management:** View and manage all leads collected from various bots in your workspace in one place.
- **Export Capability:** Export the complete list of leads to a CSV file for further analysis, marketing, or integration with external systems.
- **Search & Filter Options:** Easily search, filter, and sort leads based on criteria such as bot name, date, or lead status (if applicable).

This streamlined approach ensures efficient lead management and enables seamless integration with your broader business processes.
