# Assistants

The Assistants section allows you to create, manage, and customize AI assistants for your organization. These assistants can be trained on your specific data and configured to handle various tasks.

## Overview

The Assistants page displays a grid of all your available assistants. Each assistant is represented by a card showing:

- Assistant's avatar
- Name
- Role
- Company association
- Usage statistics

## Features

### Creating a New Assistant

To create a new assistant:

1. Navigate to the Assistants page
2. Click on the "New Assistant" card (the first card with a plus icon)
3. Fill in the required information:
   - Name
   - Role
   - Company
   - Avatar (optional)
4. Click "Create" to set up your new assistant

### Assistant Status Indicators

Each assistant card may display status indicators:

- **Missing Learning Context** (red alert icon): This indicates that the assistant needs learning context to function properly. You must add knowledge or training data before the assistant can be used effectively.

### Managing Assistants

To manage an existing assistant:

1. Click on the assistant card to open its details page
2. From there, you can:
   - Edit assistant information
   - Add or modify learning context
   - Configure response settings
   - View usage statistics
   - Test the assistant's responses

### Learning Context

For an assistant to function effectively, it needs learning context - information it can use to generate accurate and relevant responses. Without this context, the assistant will be limited in its capabilities.

To add learning context:

1. Open the assistant's details page
2. Navigate to the "Learning Context" section
3. Upload documents, add text, or connect to knowledge sources
4. Save your changes

### Assistant Statistics

Each assistant card displays key statistics:

- Number of conversations
- Response rate
- User satisfaction metrics

These metrics help you monitor the performance and usage of your assistants.

## Permissions

Access to create and manage assistants is controlled by your organization's permission settings. If you don't see the "New Assistant" card, you may not have the necessary permissions to create assistants.

## Best Practices

- Give your assistants clear, descriptive names that indicate their purpose
- Provide comprehensive learning context for better performance
- Regularly review assistant performance metrics
- Test your assistant thoroughly before deploying it to users
