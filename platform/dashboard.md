### Setting Your Date Range

To analyze data from a specific time period:

1. Click the date range selector in the top-right corner of the dashboard
2. Select your desired start and end dates from the calendar popup
3. Click "Apply" to update all dashboard metrics to reflect this time period

The dashboard defaults to showing data from your current billing cycle, but you can select any custom range to identify trends or analyze specific campaigns.

### Understanding Summary Cards

At the top of the Stats tab, you'll find summary cards that provide immediate insights:

- **Tickets Card**: Shows your total ticket count and new tickets requiring attention. Click this card to navigate directly to the Tickets section for detailed management.

- **Conversations Card**: Displays total conversation count and average messages per session. This helps you gauge overall engagement levels.

- **Subscription Card**: Shows your current plan details and renewal date. Click to access billing information and manage your subscription.

- **Top Agents Card**: Highlights which agents are handling the most conversations. Use this to identify your most active agents and their message volumes.

### Agent Activity Patterns

The dashboard provides detailed charts showing both agent messages and sessions. A session represents a complete conversation between a user and an agent, from initial contact to conclusion, while messages count each individual interaction within those sessions. You can analyze these metrics in two different views:

- **Weekly View**: Shows which days of the week have the highest activity levels for both messages and sessions
- **Hourly View**: Shows which times of day are busiest for both messages and sessions

By comparing message counts with session counts, you can identify not only when users are most active but also how engaged they are during each session.

To analyze a specific agent's performance:

1. Locate the agent dropdown selector in the performance section
2. Select the agent you want to analyze from the dropdown list
3. The charts below will automatically update to show data for only that agent

To change how you view the data:

1. Find the "Weekly/Hourly" toggle switch above the charts
2. Select "Weekly" to see patterns by day of the week (useful for identifying weekday vs. weekend trends)
3. Select "Hourly" to see patterns by time of day (useful for identifying peak usage hours)

The charts will automatically update to show:
- When your users are most actively engaging with your agents
- Message volume patterns over time
- How many leads the agent generated during the selected period

### Leads  

The Leads section in the Stats tab shows you how many leads your agents have generated:

1. **Total Leads Counter**: At the top of the chart, you'll see the total number of leads generated during your selected time period
2. **Lead Visualization**: The chart displays lead generation data for the selected agent and time period
3. **Agent-Specific Analysis**: When you select a specific agent from the dropdown, the leads chart updates to show only leads generated by that agent



This information helps you:

- Monitor lead generation performance over time
- Compare different agents' effectiveness at generating leads
- Evaluate the business impact of your agents

## Usage

The Usage tab shows your subscription credit consumption and provides a detailed breakdown of how credits are being used across different AI models. This tab helps you monitor both your regular subscription usage and any extra usage beyond your plan limits.

### Selecting a Date Range

To analyze usage for a specific time period:

1. Find the date range selector at the top of the Usage tab
2. Click to open the calendar interface
3. Select your start and end dates
4. The usage data will automatically update to reflect your selected period

### Understanding Usage Types

The Usage tab organizes your consumption data into different categories through sub-tabs:

1. **Subscription Usage**: Shows consumption within your current subscription plan
2. **Extra Usage**: Displays any usage beyond your subscription limits

### Managing Your Subscription Usage

To make the most of your subscription and avoid unexpected costs:

1. **Monitor your credit consumption rate**
   - Look at the circular progress chart in the Plan Usage card
   - Compare the percentage of billing cycle elapsed with the percentage of credits used
   - If your usage is outpacing your billing cycle (e.g., 75% of credits used when only 50% through billing cycle), consider adjusting your agent configurations or upgrading your plan

2. **Optimize your model selection**
   - In the Usage by Model section, identify which models are consuming the most credits
   - Click on models with unexpectedly high usage to investigate further
   - For cost-sensitive tasks, switch agents to more efficient models by going to the agent's settings page
   - For critical tasks requiring high accuracy, keep using premium models but limit their use to essential functions

3. **Manage your knowledge base storage**
   - If the Context Usage card shows you're approaching your storage limit, click on it to navigate to your knowledge base management page
   - Review and remove outdated or redundant documents
   - Consolidate similar content to reduce duplication
   - Compress large files before uploading them as context

4. **Respond to usage patterns**
   - In the usage chart, look for spikes that indicate unusual activity
   - Click on any spike to see a detailed breakdown of that day's usage
   - Schedule routine maintenance during historically low-usage periods shown in the chart
   - If you consistently see high usage during specific times, consider adding more specialized agents to handle the increased load during those periods

### Managing Extra Usage Costs

When you've exceeded your subscription limits and need to control costs:

1. **Analyze the cost-benefit of your current plan**
   - Compare your extra usage costs in the Extra Usage tab against the price difference for the next subscription tier
   - If your extra costs consistently exceed 75% of the upgrade price difference, click the "Upgrade Plan" button to view available options

2. **Identify and address usage spikes**
   - In the usage timeline, look for specific dates with unusually high consumption
   - Click on these dates to see which agents and models were responsible
   - Contact users or teams associated with those spikes to understand what caused the unusual activity

3. **Implement model-specific optimizations**
   - Review the model breakdown chart to see which premium models are driving extra costs
   - For the highest-cost models, go to your agents' configuration pages and adjust their settings to use more cost-effective alternatives when appropriate
   - Consider setting usage alerts by clicking the "Set Alert" button next to high-consumption models

## Agent Performance Analysis

![Agent Statistics](../images/dashboard/bot_statistics.jpg)

The Agent Performance section shows how your agents compare to each other in terms of usage and effectiveness. This view helps you understand which agents are most active and which might need attention.

### Agent Comparison

The "Top Usage by Agent" chart at the bottom of the Stats tab ranks your agents by conversation volume. This helps you:

1. Identify which agents handle the most conversations
2. See the distribution of workload across your agent team
3. Spot agents with unusually low activity that might indicate configuration issues

To use this information effectively, look for significant differences between similar agents. If two agents serve similar purposes but one receives significantly more traffic, investigate why users prefer one over the other.

### Agent Configuration Insights

When you notice an agent with lower performance metrics:

1. Click on the agent's name in the chart to navigate to its detailed configuration page
2. Review the agent's knowledge base to ensure it has appropriate context for the questions it receives
3. Check the agent's response settings to make sure they match the communication style expected by users

### Lead Conversion Tracking

The Leads chart shows how effectively your agents are converting conversations into qualified leads. To use this information:

1. Compare lead generation rates across different agents to identify your most effective lead generators
2. Note the ratio of total conversations to leads generated - a healthy conversion rate typically ranges from 5-15% depending on your industry
3. If an agent shows a sudden drop in lead conversion, check for recent changes to its configuration or knowledge base
4. Consider what factors might be contributing to higher success rates during these periods

### Top Usage by Agent

At the bottom of the Stats tab, you'll find a comprehensive breakdown of agent usage across your organization:

This chart ranks your agents by total usage volume, showing you at a glance:

1. Which agents are handling the most conversations
2. The relative workload distribution across your agent team
3. How usage patterns have changed during your selected time period

Use this information to:

- Identify your most heavily used agents that may need additional optimization
- Spot underutilized agents that might benefit from more promotion or improved configuration
- Balance workloads across your agent team by adjusting routing or knowledge bases
- Make data-driven decisions about which agents to expand or consolidate

By regularly reviewing these metrics and making incremental adjustments to your agents, you can continuously improve their performance and maximize the value of your Fineguide implementation.
