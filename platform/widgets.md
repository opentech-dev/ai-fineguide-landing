# Widgets

The Widgets section allows you to create, manage, and deploy chat widgets that can be integrated into your website or application. These widgets provide an interface for users to interact with your AI assistants directly from your digital properties.

## Overview

The Widgets page is organized into two main tabs:

1. **Widget Library** - Browse available widget templates and styles
2. **My Active Widgets** - Manage widgets you've already deployed

## Features

### Widget Library

The Widget Library tab displays a collection of pre-designed widget templates that you can use as a starting point:

- Each template has a different design, layout, and feature set
- Preview widgets before selecting them
- Filter widgets by type, features, or compatibility

To use a widget from the library:

1. Browse the available widget templates
2. Click on a widget to view its details
3. Click "Add to My Widgets" to create an instance of this widget for your use
4. Configure the widget settings as needed

### My Active Widgets

The My Active Widgets tab shows all widgets that you've added to your account:

- Each widget card displays key information:
  - Widget name
  - Associated assistant(s)
  - Status (active/inactive)
  - Integration details

For each widget, you can:

1. View detailed settings and statistics
2. Get the integration code to embed on your website
3. Edit widget configuration
4. Remove the widget from your assistants

### Widget Configuration

When adding or editing a widget, you can customize various aspects:

- **Appearance**: Colors, fonts, size, and position on your website
- **Behavior**: Initial messages, response time, availability hours
- **Integration**: Which assistant(s) the widget connects to
- **Advanced Settings**: Custom CSS, user identification, data collection preferences

### Widget Integration

To add a widget to your website:

1. Select a widget from your active widgets
2. Click "Get Code" to view the integration code
3. Copy the provided JavaScript snippet
4. Paste the code into your website's HTML, typically before the closing `</body>` tag
5. The widget will appear on your website according to your configuration settings

### Widget Management

To manage an existing widget:

1. Go to the My Active Widgets tab
2. Find the widget you want to manage
3. Use the available actions:
   - **Edit**: Modify widget settings
   - **Deactivate/Activate**: Toggle the widget's active status
   - **Remove**: Delete the widget from your account

### Permissions

Access to widget features depends on your role and permissions:

- Creating and editing widgets requires "Write" permission for the WIDGET module
- Removing widgets requires "Delete" permission for the WIDGET module

## Best Practices

- Choose widget designs that match your website's look and feel
- Configure welcome messages that clearly explain what the assistant can help with
- Test your widget thoroughly before deploying it to a production environment
- Regularly review widget analytics to understand user engagement
- Consider adding multiple widgets for different purposes or sections of your website
