## Overview
The **Features** tab allows users to configure various functionalities and behavioral settings of their AI assistants. This tab focuses on customizing user interaction, response handling, lead collection, and ticket management.

### 1. **Show Suggested Questions**
This section allows users to configure predefined questions that the assistant can suggest to users during interactions.

### 2. **Response Limitations**
