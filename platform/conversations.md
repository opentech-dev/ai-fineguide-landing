# Conversations

The Conversations section allows you to view, search, and analyze all interactions between users and your AI assistants. This feature provides valuable insights into how users are engaging with your assistants and helps you monitor the quality of responses.

## Overview

The Conversations page is divided into three main sections:

1. **Assistant Selection** - A list of all your assistants (visible when not in single-bot mode)
2. **Conversation List** - Sessions or search results for the selected assistant
3. **Message Panel** - Detailed view of messages within a selected conversation

## Features

### Selecting an Assistant

To view conversations for a specific assistant:

1. Click on the assistant card in the left sidebar
2. The conversation list will update to show only sessions for the selected assistant
3. Click on the same assistant again to deselect it and view all conversations

If you accessed the Conversations page through an assistant's details page, the system will automatically filter to show only that assistant's conversations.

### Viewing Conversation History

The conversation list displays recent sessions between users and your assistants:

- Each session entry shows the conversation start time and a snippet of the initial message
- Sessions are sorted chronologically with the most recent at the top
- Pagination controls allow you to browse through older conversations

To view the details of a specific conversation:

1. Click on a session in the list
2. The complete message thread will appear in the Message Panel on the right
3. You can scroll through the entire conversation to review the interaction

### Searching Conversations

The search functionality allows you to find specific conversations or messages:

1. Use the search bar at the top of the conversation list
2. You can search by:
   - Keywords or phrases in messages
   - UUID of a specific message or session
3. Search results will display matching messages and their surrounding context

### Filtering by Rating

You can filter conversations based on user feedback ratings:

1. Click the rating filter dropdown next to the search bar
2. Select the rating you want to filter by (All, Positive, Negative, or Unrated)
3. The conversation list will update to show only sessions with the selected rating

### Date Range Selection

To view conversations from a specific time period:

1. Click on the date range selector
2. Choose your desired start and end dates
3. The conversation list will update to show only conversations that occurred within the selected period

By default, the system shows conversations from the past week.

### Message Details

When you select a conversation, the Message Panel displays:

1. The complete message thread between the user and assistant
2. Timestamps for each message
3. User feedback ratings (if available)
4. Any system messages or context provided during the conversation

### Pagination

Both the conversation list and message panel support pagination:

- Use the page controls at the bottom of each section to navigate through results
- The current page number is highlighted to help you keep track of your position

## Best Practices

- Regularly review conversations to identify areas where assistants could be improved
- Pay special attention to conversations with negative ratings to address user pain points
- Use the search functionality to find specific topics or issues users are discussing
- Analyze conversation patterns to identify common questions that might benefit from improved assistant training
